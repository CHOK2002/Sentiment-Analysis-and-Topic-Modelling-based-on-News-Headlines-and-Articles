Millions of people are set to lose Covid-19 pandemic-era benefits this fall.  The expiration of these programs, which were created by Congress in the early years of the pandemic, will strip away economic assistance that millions of Americans have received for years and still rely on.  Lawmakers passed several sweeping pandemic relief packages during 2020 and 2021, authorizing trillions of dollars in spending on a variety of programs aimed at helping households who may be struggling economically due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The laws also put in place some key economic benefit programs long pushed by progressives, albeit on a temporary basis.  Some aid, like direct stimulus payments, expanded unemployment benefits and enhanced child tax credits, have already expired. But there’s still time for other funds, like the billions of dollars of aid for K-12 schools, to be spent.  Here are the benefits people will lose this fall Student loan payment pause Roughly 28 million people will be required to start paying their monthly student loan bills in October after a yearslong pandemic pause. Typically, those payments were between $200 and $299 in 2019 before the pause went into effect, according to the Federal Reserve. Federal student loan accounts have effectively been frozen since March 2020. But interest will resume accruing on September 1. Bills will begin going out to borrowers in September and October, at least 21 days before a borrower’s first payment is due. The pause on payments led to an increase in credit scores for federal student loan borrowers, as well as increases in their borrowing on credit cards, mortgages and auto loans, according to a paper by economists at the University of Chicago. An increase in borrowing could mean that these student loan borrowers felt more comfortable making bigger purchases or buying a home or car while their student loans were frozen. But now, the extra debt could put some borrowers at risk of struggling to afford their student loan payments when they resume. More student loan borrowers are currently behind on other kinds of bills than they were before the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a recent study by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The report also said that about 1 in 5 student loan borrowers have at least two risk factors that suggest they could struggle when scheduled payments resume, like being delinquent on student loan payments before the pandemic or having multiple student loan servicers. To ease the transition back into repayment, the Biden administration is providing a one-year on-ramp period for borrowers. While payments will be required to be made during that time, and interest will accrue, borrowers will be shielded from some of the consequences of missing their payments. They won’t be reported to credit bureaus, be considered in default or referred to collection agencies for late, missed or partial payments during the on-ramp period. Child care provider stabilization funds The American Rescue Plan Act, which Democrats in Congress passed in 2021, included $24 billion in child care stabilization grants. Providers could use the funds to improve workers’ compensation, pay for rent, mortgages and utilities, and buy personal protective equipment and other supplies, among other needs. Some 220,000 child care programs – the majority of them family home providers – received the funds, and 9.6 million children were affected, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. The average award was $23,300 for family home providers and $140,600 for child care centers as of the end of 2022. But the funding expires on September 30. More than 70,000 programs could close and about 3.2 million kids could lose their spots, according to The Century Foundation.  Suspension of work requirements for food stamps At the start of the pandemic, Congress suspended the requirement that certain adults work in order to get food stamps. But these recipients will start losing their benefits in October unless they fulfill the mandate, meet other exemption criteria or live in a “waived” area with high unemployment or limited jobs. Able-bodied adults without dependents who are between ages 18 and 49 can only receive food stamps for three months out of every three years unless they work or participate in other activities at least 20 hours a week. Under the debt ceiling package that Congress approved last month, those ages 50 to 52 will also be subject to the time limit this fall, though veterans, people experiencing homelessness and certain other adults of all ages will be newly exempt. (Those ages 53 and 54 will be subject to the work requirement starting in the fall of 2024, though the expansion beyond age 49 only lasts until the fall of 2030.) The suspension was tied to the federal public health emergency, which ended in May. The clock on the time limit started in July. At least 500,000 people are expected to lose access to food stamps when the requirement returns, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Separately, around 750,000 folks ages 50 through 54 are at risk of being disenrolled because of the temporary increase in the age limit. Continuous Medicaid coverage Millions of Americans are expected to lose their Medicaid coverage this fall as states continue reviewing residents’ eligibility and disenrolling those who no longer qualify. States had been barred by Congress from winnowing their Medicaid rolls since the Covid-19 pandemic began. That prohibition ended on April 1, but states have 14 months to complete the unwinding process. Roughly 3.2 million people have already had their coverage terminated, the majority of which are for procedural reasons, such as not completing renewal forms, according to KFF. It estimates a total of 17 million people could be disenrolled from the program. Here are some of the programs that still have funding Rental assistance During the pandemic, Congress authorized more than $46 billion for an Emergency Rental Assistance, or ERA, program aimed at helping low-income tenants pay their rent and utility bills.  The money was disbursed from the US Treasury to more than 500 local ERA programs, which have made more than 10 million payments to renters facing eviction. There was roughly $8 billion left earlier this year. But just about 13% of the programs remain open while the others have permanently closed or stopped accepting applications because money is running low, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. The local ERA programs were allowed to set different qualifying criteria for applicants. But generally, tenants must meet an income requirement, show they lost income during the Covid-19 pandemic and demonstrate a risk of homelessness in order to qualify for the money. K-12 schools Congress authorized more than $190 billion during 2020 and 2021 to help America’s schools reopen and stay open during the pandemic.  While a lot of the funds were used quickly to buy personal protective equipment, upgrade ventilation and boost summer school programs, billions of dollars remain. Schools have until September 30, 2024, to spend the money.  Initially, schools were slow to spend the money, but they are now on track to use all the funds available by the deadline, according to Edunomics Lab, a research center at Georgetown University.  Help paying for child care As part of their effort to help lower-income parents pay for child care, Democratic lawmakers provided $15 billion to states to expand assistance and improve the quality of care as part of the American Rescue Plan Act. States are using the funding in a variety of ways, including covering part or all of the cost of copayments, boosting the income limit to qualify for assistance and increasing payment rates to providers. The funding must be used by September 2024. Relief funds for state and local governments The American Rescue Plan Act provided $350 billion for state, local, territorial and tribal governments to help them contend with and recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. Recipients can use the funds to replace revenue lost because of the pandemic, support public health initiatives, assist residents, small businesses, nonprofit groups and others who were hit economically, provide premium pay for essential workers and invest in water, sewer and broadband infrastructure. Governments must spend the money by the end of 2026. Here are some the main relief measures that are long gone Stimulus checks The federal government sent out three rounds of stimulus payments, also known as economic impact payments, directly to low- and middle-income taxpayers during 2020 and 2021.  Each round was worth a different amount. The largest was sent in 2021 and was worth a maximum of $1,400 per taxpayer and another $1,400 per dependent.  In total, more than 476 million payments totaling $814 billion in financial relief went to households, according to the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee. Expanded unemployment benefits Congress enacted a historic expansion of unemployment benefits to help Americans deal with the economic upheaval sparked by the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020. A key component of the relief effort was a federal weekly supplement for out-of-work Americans. The jobless received a $600-a-week boost from April through July of 2020. Congress then revived the enhancement in late December 2020 but reduced it to $300 a week. That supplement expired in September 2021, though many states led by Republicans and one with a Democratic governor ended it earlier. Lawmakers also created two other major measures to aid the jobless. The Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program provided payments for freelancers, the self-employed, independent contractors and certain people affected by the outbreak, while the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program extended payments for those who exhausted their regular state benefits. Those programs also ended by September 2021. A total of about $878 billion in pandemic unemployment benefits were paid from April 2020 through September 2022, according to the Government Accountability Office, citing Department of Labor data. Enhanced child tax credit Democratic lawmakers greatly expanded the child tax credit for 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act.  The three-part enhancement increased the maximum credit to $3,600 for children under age 6 and $3,000 for those ages 6 through 17. Heads of households earning up to $112,500 a year and married couples making up to $150,000 were eligible for the full amount. Also, it made the credit fully refundable so the lowest-income families could qualify. And it sent half the credit to families in monthly installments of up to $300 from July through December 2021 to help them cover expenses. Parents claimed the other half when they filed their 2021 tax returns. More than 36 million families with more than 61 million kids received monthly payments, which totaled more than $93 billion, according to the Internal Revenue Service. Prior to the expansion, eligible parents received a credit of up to $2,000 for children up to age 17 when they filed their taxes. The credit returned to that amount for 2022 and beyond. The beefed-up credit lifted 2.1 million kids above the poverty line and reduced the child poverty rate by 2.9 percentage points to 5.2% in 2021, according to the US Census Bureau’s Supplemental Poverty Measure. Small business loans The Paycheck Protection Program, known as PPP, was a key part of the federal government’s immediate response to the pandemic.  The program was designed to get money out as quickly as possible to small business owners who were struggling to pay their employees. Small business owners who used the money for a qualifying reason, like payroll, would see their loan forgiven. The program provided 11.5 million loans totaling nearly $790 billion.  american rescue plan, banking, finance and investments, biden's first 100 days, brand safety-nsf health issues, brand safety-nsf sensitive, business, economy and trade, child care, children, consumer loans and credit, coronavirus, coronavirus pandemic, demographic groups, diseases and disorders, domestic alerts, domestic-business, domestic-coronavirus, domestic-health and science, domestic-us politics, economic policy, economy and economic indicators, education, employment and income status, epidemics and outbreaks, families and children, family members and relatives, filing taxes, financial aid in education, government and public administration, government organizations - us, health and medical, iab-business, iab-business and finance, iab-business banking & finance, iab-college education, iab-daycare and pre-school, iab-diseases and conditions, iab-economy, iab-education, iab-family and relationships, iab-financial assistance, iab-financial regulation, iab-government support and welfare, iab-industries, iab-infectious diseases, iab-law, iab-lung and respiratory health, iab-medical health, iab-parenting, iab-personal debt, iab-personal finance, iab-personal loans, iab-politics, iab-real estate industry, iab-student financial aid, infectious diseases, international alerts, international-business, international-coronavirus, international-health and science, international-us politics, labor and employment, law and legal system, life forms, microscopic life, parents and parenting, personal finance, politics, population and demographics, public finance, public health, respiratory diseases, social and economic status, social assistance, social assistance and welfare, society, student expenses and financing, students and student life, tax deductions and credits, tax law, taxes and taxation, unemployment, us congress, viruses, workers and professionals  politics             https://edition.cnn.com/2023/07/25/politics/covid-19-relief-programs-ending/index.html\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Peru is seeing some of its worst political violence in recent decades, but the grievances of protesters are all but new; they reflect a system that has failed to deliver for over twenty years. Sparked by the ousting of former President Pedro Castillo last month, some of Peru’s most intense protests have taken place in the south of the country where dozens of people were killed in violent clashes with security forces over the last few weeks.  This region, around the Andean Mountain range at over ten thousand feet above sea level and home to some of Peru’s most famous archeological sites like the ancient ruins of Machu Picchu and the city of Cusco, is also one of the poorest in the country. In recent days, protesters from this and other rural regions of Peru have started travelling towards the capital, Lima – sometimes for days – to express their grievances to the country’s leadership and demand that the current president, Dina Boluarte, to step down. Their anger highlights a much deeper democratic crisis. After years of political bedlam, Peru is a country that has fallen out of love with democracy: both the presidency and congress are widely discredited and perceived as corrupt institutions.  A 2021 poll by LAPOP, a survey research laboratory at Vanderbilt University, revealed that only 21% of Peruvians said they are satisfied with democratic rule, the least in any country in Latin American and the Caribbean except Haiti.  Worryingly, more than half of Peruvians who took part in that poll said a military takeover of the country would be justified under a high degree of corruption.  At the core of the crisis are demands for better living conditions that have gone unfulfilled in the two decades since democratic rule was restored in the country. Peru is one of the youngest democracies in the Americas, with free and fair elections having been restored only in the year 2001 after the ousting of right wing leader Alberto Fujimori.  Peru’s economy flourished both under Fujimori and in the years that followed the restoration of democracy, outpacing almost any other in the region thanks to robust exports of raw material and healthy foreign investments. The term Lima Consensus, after the Peruvian capital, was coined to describe the system of free-market policies that Peruvian elites promoted to fuel the economic boom.   But while the economy boomed, state institutions were inherently weakened by a governing philosophy that reduced state intervention to a minimum.  As early as 2014, Professor Steven Levitsky of Harvard University, highlighted a particular Peruvian paradox: While in most democracies public opinion reflects the state of the economy, in Peru presidential approval ratings consistently plummeted during the 2000s, even as growth soared, he wrote in journal Revista. Levitsky highlighted chronic deficiencies in security, justice, education, and other basic services from Peru’s successive governments as threats to the young democracy’s sustainability. “Security, justice, education and other basic services continue to be under-provided, resulting in widespread perceptions of government corruption, unfairness, ineffectiveness and neglect. This is a major source of public discontent. Where such perceptions persist, across successive governments, public trust in democratic institutions is likely to erode,” he wrote, an observation that today seems prophetic.    The Covid-19 pandemic only exacerbated this structural weakness at the core of the Peruvian society. Whereas many countries expanded social safety nets to counter the damaging economic impact of lockdowns, Peru had no net to fall back on.  According to the United Nations, over half of the Peruvian populations lacked access to enough food in the months of the Covid-19 pandemic, as the virus swept around the country. Data from Johns Hopkins University also show that Peru recorded the highest per-capita death toll in the world due to coronavirus. The country’s economy is back on track after the pandemic shock – Peru’s GDP grew an astonishing 13.3% in 2021 – but public trust in democratic institutions has broken down, just as Levitsky predicted.   A poll published September 2022 by IEP showed 84% of Peruvians disapproved Congress’s performance. Lawmakers are perceived not only as pursuing their own interests in Congress, but are also associated with corrupt practices. The country’s frustrations have been reflected in its years-long revolving door presidency. Current president Boluarte is the sixth head of state in less than five years.  Her predecessor Castillo rose to power in 2021’s general elections, styled as man of the people who would get the country a fresh start. But polarization and the chaos surrounding his presidency – including corruption allegations and multiple impeachment attempts by Congress, which Castillo dismissed as politically motivated – only exacerbated pre-existing tensions.  Cautionary tale Most protesters who spoke with CNN on Wednesday said the country needs a fresh start and demanded new elections across the board to restore a sense of legitimacy to public institutions.  But Boluarte and legislators have so far resisted calls for early general elections. On Sunday, the president declared a state of emergency in the areas of the country most affected by the protests, including Lima. The measure is due to last until mid-February but that has not stopped more people from taking to the streets.  Peru’s Attorney General meanwhile has opened an investigation into Boluarte’s handling of the unrest.   But even if the current leadership were to go and yet another politician raised to the presidency, the root causes of Peru’s unrest persist.  As in many other regions of Latin America, addressing those issues requires structural change in terms of social and economic equality, tackling the cost-of-living crisis and fighting corruption.  Across the region, the pandemic has proven a reality check after years of economic and social development under democratic regimes gave the impression that Latin America had finally put the era of coups, dictatorships and revolt behind its back.

                                         Three years have passed since Athing Mu was last beaten in an 800-meter race. In that time, she’s been crowned American champion, Olympic champion and world champion in the distance – all before the age of 21.  The extraordinary start to her professional running career has led many, with good reason, to view Mu as the most exciting athlete in track and field at the moment. When she held off a late challenge from Great Britain’s Keely Hodgkinson to win gold at the world championships last year, Mu became the youngest woman in history to own Olympic and world titles in an individual track and field event.  Given her meteoric rise and remarkable success since turning professional, it’s perhaps unsurprising that Mu is feeling the weight of her past performances.  “There’s pressure, for sure,” she tells CNN Sport from Los Angeles, California, where she has recently moved for a new training program.  “And not only from obviously the outside world, but for myself, too, knowing that I was able to do these two things the past two years – these really big, incredible things.” It was January 2022 – 13 races ago – when Mu last failed to win an event of any distance.  She was scheduled to run at the Millrose Games in New York this month but withdrew several days before the event, saying she wanted to focus on the outdoor season and the upcoming world championships. “I would love to keep that streak,” says Mu. “I think the main thing for me is to continue to believe and know that no matter what happens, the only person going to be affected by whatever the result is, whether good or bad, is going to be myself.  “I know the mental challenges that I have to go through. I just have to help relieve myself mentally on that aspect by knowing that nothing is perfect and whatever happens is going to happen.” The athlete most likely to end Mu’s streak appears to be Hodgkinson, who ran a world-leading time of 1:23.41 in the 600 meters last month. The 20-year-old Mu is just three months younger than her rival and to date holds the bragging rights in their head-to-head over 800 meters.  She raced clear of Hodgkinson – and the rest of the field – in the final straight at the Tokyo Olympics, then edged out the Brit after a thrilling sprint finish at the world championships in Oregon last year.  “Whichever way it goes – whether she has the fastest time or I have the fastest time – it just reminds me of the friendly competition we have between one another, how that started a couple of years ago and how we’re still battling it out together,” says Mu. Between them, we may one day see a new world record in the women’s 800 meters. The current mark of 1:53.28, set by the Czech Republic’s Jarmila Kratochvílová in 1983, is the longest-standing outdoor world record in track and field.  Mu’s best time, set at the world championships, is almost two seconds outside that, but a healthy rivalry might help her on her way.  “I know battling it out [with Hodgkinson] is only going to be good for us individually,” says Mu, “and it’s going to be good as a collective goal in the 800 period because we’re kind of bringing it back to the old days when it was a key event.  “It’s nice to see this event move on as the future goes.” Regardless of what her future holds, Mu’s incredible winning streak has already made the athletics world sit up and take notice.  Her height and long, effortless stride make for an elegant running style over middle-distance events, though Mu has competed in everything from 200 meters up to the mile as a junior and professional.  “I see poetry in motion – just the smoothest runner I’ve probably ever seen,” 400-meter hurdles world record holder Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone has said about her relay teammate. “She has so much ahead of her.”  Mu and McLaughlin-Levrone, who both train under famed track coach Bob Kersee in Los Angeles, were part of the gold-medal-winning 4x400-meter relay team at the Tokyo Olympics, while another member of the team, the recently-retired Allyson Felix, acted as a mentor for Mu before and during the Games.  “She’s probably the person that was in contact with the younger athletes that were moving in as she was going out,” says Mu.  “She’s one of those athletes who wants to give back, and I can definitely tell because she spoke so well about the younger athletes competing with her.” But before Mu was able to turn to Felix – the USA’s most decorated track and field athlete – for advice and inspiration, she had her family.  The second-youngest of seven children, she grew up watching her siblings excel at track running during high school. Before long, her chance arrived.  “Honestly, I kind of just fell in line,” says Mu. “By the time it was my turn, everyone was or did have their time in athletics. It was just in time to support me, put me into the sport and teach me their ways.” Mu was born in Trenton, New Jersey, a year after her family had emigrated to the United States from South Sudan. She often alludes to her family heritage, notably by carrying both the American and South Sudanese flags when she returned home from the Olympics.   “My whole entire family, including me, is South Sudanese, and I have that blood in me as well,” says Mu. “I definitely know that my mom especially appreciates it, along with my dad, to still be representing and not leaving that part of me too far away.” It’s unclear when the first race of the year will be for Mu. She hopes to run more events outside her favored 800-meter distance in the future, and there are also the world championships in Budapest, Hungary, to target in August.  It looks set to be another big year ahead.  “Of course, I would love to be the world champion again,” says Mu, before quickly reeling in her expectations.  “I’ve moved on to this new environment [in LA], new training, new coach – it’s a lot to adjust to. I’m just taking it slow – day by day, practice by practice, meet by meet – and seeing where this year takes me.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    athletes, continents and regions, domestic alerts, domestic-us news, iab-olympic sports, iab-sports, iab-track and field, international alerts, international-us news, north america, olympics, sports and recreation, sports events, the americas, track and field, united states     sport         https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/17/sport/athing-mu-interview-athletics-spt-intl/index.html\n",

As the new year got underway in China, hopes appeared to be running high that an easing of tensions with the United States could unfold in the months ahead. China’s Foreign Ministry expressed as much late last month when it said China would “welcome” a visit from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken – an expected visit that analysts say Beijing viewed as an opportunity to help strengthen its economy and repair fraught diplomatic ties. So when a high-altitude balloon from China carrying a payload the size of three coach buses equipped with what American officials have described as surveillance equipment was spotted over the continental US, visibly hovering above a state with key military assets and ultimately sparking an international incident – it naturally raised critical questions about just what had happened, and why.   China maintains the vessel, which was shot down by the US over the Atlantic Ocean on Saturday, was a weather balloon thrown off course. And it has shown signs of both being caught off guard by the incident and wanting to stem the potential damage, analysts say, not only framing the situation as the result of factors beyond its control, but also offering a rare expression of “regret” over it in a statement Friday. While some crucial facts of the situation remain unclear, Beijing’s official response – and the timing of the incident, which resulted in the US’ postponement of the Blinken visit – suggest its leadership is now grappling with how to handle a diplomatic crisis that has inflamed the very tensions it had been hoping to mend.  “By all accounts, the Chinese leadership was looking forward to having direct talks with Blinken … it would be very plausible that (Chinese leader Xi Jinping) would want to make sure everything was smooth in the lead up to the visit,” said Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore.  “That this would happen is perplexing and strange,” he said.  The possibilities  Beijing has given sparse details on the origins of the balloon, which it first confirmed was from China in an explanation issued more than 12 hours after the Pentagon announced it was tracking the object. In a statement released late Friday evening local time, China’s Foreign Ministry described the balloon as a “civilian airship used for research, mainly meteorological,” which had deviated “far from its planned course” due to “limited self-steering capability” and westerly winds.  In a follow-up statement Sunday, Beijing appeared to link the device to “companies,” rather than its government or military – though in China the prominence of state-owned enterprises and a robust military-industrial complex blurs the line between the two. On Monday, Beijing admitted a second balloon in recent days “seriously deviated” from its planned course and entered the skies over Latin America and the Caribbean “by mistake.” It declined, however, to provide more information on which entity manufactured the balloons. The US, meanwhile, has presented details that frame the incident as part of a surveillance effort powered by a fleet of Chinese spy balloons it says have been spotted across five continents over the past several years.  Observers of elite Chinese politics say the timing of the less-than-subtle intrusion, amid a concerted Chinese effort to re-engage with the world and tone down its own combative rhetoric, suggests explanations ranging from a serious miscalculation by Beijing to a costly lack of communication within the government or with another entity. Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute at the University of London, said any surveillance operation involving US airspace would “almost certainly” have to get approval from top leadership, including Xi.  That suggests, according to Tsang, there was either a “total miscalculation” in which the Chinese leader and his advisers thought the US would not respond robustly to the balloon, or the top leaders failed to “join the dots” between various activities to realize dispatching a balloon would have the potential to impact the Blinken visit.  “Xi wanted Blinken to visit and discuss issues of mutual interest. Xi is trying to patch up the economy after the disaster of the zero-Covid policy and US restrictions on semiconductors. So, he could not have wanted an incident over the balloon that would derail such a meeting,” he added. Chong in Singapore raised another possibility: Like many other big bureaucracies … the right hand may not know what the left hand is doing and there may be a simple matter of the lack of coordination,” he said. The fallout While the backstory remains unclear as Chinese authorities have yet to – and may not – provide additional information, the result of the incident is a major blow for US-China diplomacy – and Beijing, experts say. “I think the Chinese leadership at the national level clearly felt upset and upstaged by this balloon,” said Dali Yang, a political scientist at the University of Chicago, noting the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s initial explanation was “unusually conciliatory” with its rare expression of “regret,” especially compared with its often aggressive rhetoric of recent years. “They were clearly hoping that this somehow could be smoothed out, especially given the context of Secretary Blinken’s planned visit at that point,” Yang said.  Beijing’s rhetoric hardened significantly after the US military shot down the balloon, with China’s Foreign Ministry accusing the US of “overreacting” and “seriously violating international practice.” The Defense Ministry, meanwhile, expressed “solemn protest,” warning China “reserves the right to use necessary means to deal with similar situations.” On Monday, China’s Foreign Ministry said the debris of the balloon does not belong to the US. “The airship is China’s, not the US’,” a spokesperson for the ministry said at a regular news conference, when asked about whether the US should return the remnants of the balloon to China. “This is a delicate matter that played out in a highly public way between the two countries. Therefore, there is posturing,” Yang added. “For the Chinese leadership, they have a domestic audience they need to cater to too,” he said, citing the need for Beijing not to appear weak.  Nevertheless, China has shown signs of trying to keep a lid on nationalist rhetoric around the incident, instead of fanning outrage – as Beijing previously did during events that stoked US-China tensions, such as then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan last summer. Chinese state media on Saturday also announced the head of the country’s weather service was relieved of his duty, in a move seen by some analysts as an attempt to shore up Beijing’s position the high-altitude balloon was of civilian nature mainly for meteorological purposes. The official, however, had already been expected to depart after being appointed to a new post in January. But the diplomatic fallout from the incident will have serious, lasting consequences, experts say. “This balloon incident now sets us back significantly, because the calendar of US-China relations just over the next several months does not allow a whole lot of space for the two sides to reset,” said Jude Blanchette, the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), adding the meeting had been a chance for setting some boundaries for the relationship. China will hold its annual legislative sessions next month, when a reshuffle of leadership in the central government will be formalized. In the US, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is reportedly planning to visit Taiwan – a move that will inevitably spark the ire of Beijing. “The relationship I think is just heading to a very, very dark place if the two sides don’t find some way to put a floor underneath,” Blanchette said.

                                        Many top business leaders are seriously worried that artificial intelligence could pose an existential threat to humanity in the not-too-distant future. Forty-two percent of CEOs surveyed at the Yale CEO Summit this week say AI has the potential to destroy humanity five to ten years from now, according to survey results shared exclusively with CNN.  “It’s pretty dark and alarming,” Yale professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld said in a phone interview, referring to the findings. The survey, conducted at a virtual event held by Sonnenfeld’s Chief Executive Leadership Institute, found little consensus about the risks and opportunities linked to AI.  Sonnenfeld said the survey included responses from 119 CEOs from a cross-section of business, including Walmart CEO Doug McMillion, Coca-Cola CEO James Quincy, the leaders of IT companies like Xerox and Zoom as well as CEOs from pharmaceutical, media and manufacturing. The business leaders displayed a sharp divide over just how dangerous AI is to civilization. While 34% of CEOs said AI could potentially destroy humanity in ten years and 8% said that could happen in five years, 58% said that could never happen and they are “not worried.” In a separate question, Yale found that 42% of the CEOs surveyed say the potential catastrophe of AI is overstated, while 58% say it is not overstated. The findings come just weeks after dozens of AI industry leaders, academics and even some celebrities signed a statement warning of an “extinction” risk from AI. That statement, signed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Geoffrey Hinton, the “godfather of AI” and top executives from Google and Microsoft, called for society to take steps to guard against the dangers of AI. “Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war,” the statement said.  Blowing the whistle on AI Hinton recently decided to sound the alarm on the technology he helped develop after worrying about just how intelligent it has become. “I’m just a scientist who suddenly realized that these things are getting smarter than us,” Hinton told CNN’s Jake Tapper in May. “I want to sort of blow the whistle and say we should worry seriously about how we stop these things getting control over us.” Hinton told CNN that if AI “gets to be much smarter than us, it will be very good at manipulation,”  including “getting around restrictions we put on it.” While business leaders debate the dangers of AI, the CEOs surveyed by Yale displayed a degree of agreement about the rewards.  Just 13% of the CEOs said the potential opportunity of AI is overstated, while 87% said it is not.  The CEOs indicated AI will have the most transformative impact in three key industries: healthcare (48%), professional services/IT (35%) and media/digital (11%).  As some inside and outside the tech world debate doomsday scenarios around AI, there are likely to be more immediate impacts, including the risks of misinformation and the loss of jobs.  ‘Talking past each other’ Sonnenfeld, the Yale management guru, told CNN business leaders break down into five distinct camps when it comes to AI. The first group, as described by Sonnenfeld, includes “curious creators” who are “naïve believers” who argue everything you can do, you should do.  “They are like Robert Oppenheimer, before the bomb,” Sonnenfeld said, referring to the American physicist known as the “father of the atomic bomb.” Then there are the “euphoric true believers” who only see the good in technology, Sonnenfeld said. Noting the AI boom set off by the popularity of ChatGPT and other new tools, Sonnenfeld described “commercial profiteers” who are enthusiastically seeking to cash in on the new technology. “They don’t know what they’re doing, but they’re racing into it,” he said. And then there are the two camps pushing for an AI crackdown of sorts: alarmist activists and global governance advocates. “These five groups are all talking past each other, with righteous indignation,” Sonnenfeld said.  The lack of consensus around how to approach AI underscores how even captains of industry are still trying to wrap their heads around the risks and rewards around what could be a real gamechanger for society.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      artificial intelligence, business and industry sectors, business executives, business, economy and trade, computer science and information technology, domestic alerts, domestic-business, domestic-health and science, iab-artificial intelligence, iab-business, iab-business administration, iab-business and finance, iab-computing, iab-executive leadership & management, iab-industries, iab-technology & computing, iab-technology industry, international alerts, international-business, international-health and science, labor and employment, technology, workers and professionals  business        https://edition.cnn.com/2023/06/14/business/artificial-intelligence-ceos-warning/index.html\n",

drawdown yet in US military assistance to Ukraine, but there are lurking concerns that Republicans wielding newfound power in Washington could stand in the way of future aid -- especially as chaos brews in the House.

                  The Biden administration on Friday announced its largest drawdown yet in US military assistance to Ukraine, but there are lurking concerns that Republicans wielding newfound power in Washington could stand in the way of future aid – especially as chaos brews in the House.  The administration announced a new $2.85 billion drawdown for Ukraine, part of more than $3 billion in new military assistance to Ukraine. The drawdown, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Friday, will include “Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, artillery systems, armored personnel carriers, surface to air missiles, ammunition, and other items to support Ukraine as it bravely defends its people, its sovereignty, and its territorial integrity.” Blinken said the administration would work with Congress to “to provide an additional $907 million of Foreign Military Financing under the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2022.” “Funds will support Ukraine and countries impacted by Russia’s war in Ukraine,” Blinken said in a statement. California GOP Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who served as House minority leader in the last session and is now pursuing the House speakership, said in October that Republicans might pull back funding for Ukraine in 2023 if they took the majority in the 2022 midterm elections. Still, after making those comments the GOP leader worked behind the scenes to reassure national security leaders in his conference that he wasn’t planning to abandon Ukraine aid and was just calling for greater oversight of any federal dollars.  But there’s now concern that McCarthy’s troubled bid for the speakership – a history-defying effort that has led to more than a dozen unsuccessful votes this week – could put further limitations on Ukraine aid.  Two of the Republicans who had opposed McCarthy until Friday afternoon – Florida Rep. Byron Donalds and Texas Rep. Chip Roy – had called on the House to change leadership and debate rules over Ukraine aid. Other Ukraine aid skeptics have continued to oppose McCarthy’s bid. Several Republican members who switched their votes to support McCarthy on Friday said they are encouraged by a framework of an agreement, but provided no specifics about the deal and said talks are ongoing. For now, concern among Biden administration officials about the possibility of shrinking aid is somewhat tempered by the $45 billion in Ukraine assistance that Congress approved as part of its massive spending bill at the end of last year.  That number was even higher than President Joe Biden requested – a reflection of Democrats’ concern that additional funding wouldn’t be as forthcoming in a GOP-led House. In some ways, that number was an insurance policy against Republican resistance and the view inside the White House was that that figure would sustain US support for several months. Administration officials are doubtful additional Ukraine aid will be passed this fiscal year. They believe the $45 billion will be the last major package of Ukraine aid before the current spending package expires on September 30.  Rules changes to the budgetary process could significantly hamper Congress’ ability to pass new aid come September and certain conservative Republicans have vowed to oppose any new Ukraine funding. There are also concerns among foreign diplomats about the implications the House speaker negotiations could have on the future of US support for Ukraine. One diplomat told CNN they believe the impasse “definitely” signals trouble for Ukraine aid moving forward, as many of those who have fought McCarthy’s speakership have in the past spoken out against additional assistance for Kyiv. “This is a harbinger for a protracted legislative paralysis,” the diplomat said, adding that “the Freedom Caucus – which is not particularly pro-Ukrainian – has just demonstrated its clout.” Others noted they were watching closely to see the kinds of maneuvers McCarthy would make to secure the role, which could potentially include cuts to aid. Another diplomat told CNN they’re personally concerned about “the policy concessions McCarthy has to make, and if they are going to affect US role in the world.” A third diplomat expressed concerns concessions like crucial committee assignments, such as the House Rules Committee, could be given to lawmakers who have advocated against more aid to Ukraine, which could create immense hurdles for passing additional assistance legislation. White House officials, before the current predicament on Capitol Hill, were skeptical that Ukraine aid would dry up completely. They have pointed out Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell is among the most ardent supporters of Ukraine, and note McCarthy has pledged continued support for Ukraine. Biden relayed in November that he did not believe Ukraine aid would dry up in a Republican Congress, saying that he “would be surprised if leader McCarthy even has a majority of his Republican colleagues who say they’re not going to fund the legitimate defensive needs of Ukraine.”  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday welcomed the latest drawdown, saying it was an “awesome Christmas present for Ukraine!” And lawmakers in Ukraine told CNN they are not concerned that the future of assistance is at risk, noting the strong past bipartisan and public support for aiding their country.  One lawmaker noted that the presumed incoming Republican heads of the Foreign Affairs and Armed Services committees are strong supporters of Ukraine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         brand safety-nsf sensitive, brand safety-nsf war and military, brand safety-nsf weapons, continents and regions, domestic alerts, domestic-international news, domestic-us politics, eastern europe, europe, government and public administration, government bodies and offices, government departments and authorities, government organizations - us, iab-politics, international alerts, international assistance, international relations, international relations and national security, international-us politics, joe biden, kevin mccarthy, legislation, military, political figures - us, political organizations, politics, state departments and diplomatic services, ukraine, us congress, us house of representatives, us political parties, us republican party  politics               https://edition.cnn.com/2023/01/06/politics/ukraine-aid-republicans-biden/index.html\n",

How a Pennsylvania community is coping during a manhunt for an escaped killer                             Heavily wooded neighborhoods, curvy roads lined with lush trees, and homes that sit on large

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Heavily wooded neighborhoods, curvy roads lined with lush trees, and homes that sit on large plots of land – that’s what authorities in eastern Pennsylvania are competing with as the search for an escaped convicted murderer enters its seventh day. Danelo Cavalcante, 34, escaped from Chester County Prison last Thursday, sending authorities into a multiday search in Pocopson Township and Chester County within 2 miles of the prison – a rural area around 30 miles west of Philadelphia. The search perimeter expanded a bit this week after a trail camera recorded Cavalcante on Monday at Longwood Gardens, a popular botanical garden nearly 3 miles from the prison, and just south of where police were looking for him.  Longwood Gardens remained closed Wednesday due to ongoing law enforcement activity and for the safety of guests, the gardens said on social media. Orange and white-striped cones lined the entrance, deterring people, outside of emergency vehicles, from the grounds.  The escape has community members looking over their shoulders and thinking twice about how they secure their property – but ultimately wondering how long they’re going to be asked to stay home. With two school districts closed for the second day in a row, children are among those forced to stay inside while they normally would be in class. “This is a dangerous game of tactical hide and seek,” Robert Clark, supervisory deputy US marshal for Pennsylvania’s eastern district, told CNN’s Laura Coates Tuesday night. “And it takes time.” Joe Annechino used to leave his garage door open at night, he told CNN affiliate WPVI. Annechino lives in Unionville, just under 5 miles from the botanical garden. “I just put a couple of new bolts on two doors,” he said. “I keep the car locked. So, yes, unfortunately, I have changed my way of thinking about my exposure to whatever.” And though residents are taking extra precautions, some say they have to continue living their lives. Hair salon owner Aimee Young-Wilson told CNN Tuesday it’s business as usual for her and her clients. As cars raced past her business on a busy main artery in Chester County, you’d never know just hours prior Cavalcante was spotted less than a mile away at the botanical gardens on security camera footage. While Cavalcante’s appearance was unchanged, Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said he had obtained some items, including a backpack, a “duffel-sling type pack,” and a hooded sweatshirt. Cavalcante was convicted of first-degree murder on August 16 in the killing of his former girlfriend, 33-year-old Deborah Brandão, in 2021. Days later, he was sentenced to life without parole. The inmate escaped from Chester County Prison’s exterior exercise yard, acting Warden Howard Holland said during a news conference Wednesday. “It’s very crazy,” Young-Wilson said. “I just don’t understand how someone stays on the run for this long.” Woods that stretch for miles, ravines, and tall grass in the area are likely providing several prime hiding spaces for Cavalcante, who is 5 foot, 120 pounds, Clark said. Jennifer Briggs and her family live in the Pocopson Township area, about a mile and a half from the prison. She told CNN she’s been keeping her kids inside and having them sleep in her bedroom at night, with the doors locked, as a precaution. Briggs has a 4-year-old and a kindergartner, who just started school at Pocopson Elementary School last week but they’re attending virtually because of the manhunt. Police searched her car on Saturday afternoon, noting there’s only one way in and one way out of her neighborhood. “Anytime you would leave, they were searching your car to make sure he wasn’t in the car,” Briggs said. “I had my kids in the car with me, so that was probably the most unsettling moment.” Nancy Sanchez is using the buddy system to make sure her employees stay safe as they leave from a shift at the restaurant she manages, GuGu Asian Table, which is just a few businesses away from Young-Wilson’s salon. “We’re letting our younger workers and women park close to the building and not toward the back of the lot, so the security camera can watch,” she told CNN Tuesday. “We have lighting, so they are not scared. A lot of our servers are high schoolers and girls. We have one of the chefs watch as we leave.” The restaurant used to keep a back door to their basement open for drivers bringing in produce and fish, but now they’ve been keeping it closed, Sanchez said. Overall, businesses on the outskirts of the manhunt perimeter, like Downtown Kennett Square – filled with antique shops, quaint food spots, boutiques and a library – seemed to be operating as usual. Closures varied from business to business with a few people wandering into shops. “Everyone is just worried because he’s here, he’s dangerous and there’s a lot of elderly folks that live around the area,” Young-Wilson said. “But we can’t shut down.

                                                  President Joe Biden just made a point that’s surprising to those of us who’ve been closely following his administration’s approach to migration at the southern border.   “I don’t like Title 42,” Biden told reporters following a speech at the White House Thursday afternoon.   That comment was startling because it came minutes after his administration announced a program that effectively expands the controversial public health restrictions yet again.  It was another sign that even as the administration publicly decries Title 42 and says it’s preparing to end it, officials have repeatedly turned to the Trump-era policy as a tool to manage a spiraling situation at the border. Since March 2020, Title 42 has allowed officials to swiftly expel migrants who crossed the border illegally, all in the name of Covid-19 prevention. There have been nearly 2.5 million expulsions – mostly under the Biden administration. Officials have claimed court decisions left them with no other choice, but they’ve also chosen to expand the policy beyond any court’s order.  Immigrant rights advocates say this is hypocritical and unnecessary, and argue it’s high time for officials to stop using public health as a pretext to block migrants from seeking asylum in the United States. Republican-led states argue Title 42 has become a crucial policy at the border, and that lifting it will cause chaos amid an expected spike in border crossings. Biden’s assertion Thursday that he doesn’t like Title 42 came in response to a reporter’s question about why it’s taken him so long to visit the border (His scheduled visit to El Paso Sunday will be the first of his presidency).  The president blamed uncertainty over Title 42’s future for the delay, adding that he felt he had to make the trip and take further action once it became clear that the Supreme Court wouldn’t rule on the policy until later this year. “I wanted to make sure that I knew what the outcome was, at least the near outcome was, on Title 42, before I went down,” Biden said. “We don’t have that yet…I don’t like Title 42. But it’s the law now, and I have to operate within it.”  This timeline shows the administration’s shifting stance on Title 42  Over the past two years, the Biden administration has sent mixed messages about where it stands on the policy.  Thursday was just the latest example.  Here’s a quick look at how the administration’s stance has shifted:    Biden says Title 42’s effects make problems at the border ‘even worse’ In separate press briefings discussing the new program Thursday, Mayorkas and Biden acknowledged that Title 42 has increased the number of illegal border crossings. “People are turned away under Title 42, and they’re not barred from trying to come back. They can and they do try to enter the United States again and again, which makes the problem at the border even worse,” Biden said, noting that it won’t be until later this year that the Supreme Court finally decides whether the policy can be ended. “In the meantime, my administration will continue to use that authority as the Supreme Court has required,” he said. “And until Congress passes the funds, a comprehensive immigration plan to fix the system completely, my administration is going to work to make the situation at the border better using the tools that we have available to us now.” It’s clear the Biden administration still sees Title 42 as one of those tools, even as officials try to distance themselves from the policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      border control, brand safety-nsf health issues, brand safety-nsf sensitive, continents and regions, domestic alerts, domestic-health and science, domestic-international news, domestic-us politics, government and public administration, government bodies and offices, government organizations - us, health and medical, iab-law, iab-medical health, iab-politics, immigration, immigration, citizenship and displacement, international alerts, international relations, international relations and national security, international-health and science, international-us politics, joe biden, latin america, national security, north america, political figures - us, politics, public health, south america, territorial and national borders, the americas, united states, us federal court system, us federal government, us supreme court, venezuela  politics                 https://edition.cnn.com/2023/01/05/politics/biden-title-42-analysis-cec/index.html\n",

At least 10 Cuban migrants died and 17 others were injured when the truck they were traveling in overturned in southern Mexico on Sunday, Mexican authorities say. The truck was “irregularly” transporting 27 Cuban nationals on the Pijijiapan-Tonalá  highway in the southern state of Chiapas when the accident occurred, Mexico’s National Migration Institute (INM) said in a statement. Officials said initial reports suggested the driver had been speeding and lost control of the unit, fleeing the scene after it overturned. The 10 victims were female and included a minor, authorities said. All the injured are being treated in hospital. “The INM will establish communication with the consular authorities to initiate the administrative process for the repatriation of the bodies to their country of origin and is aware of the evolution of the health status of those seriously injured,” the statement said. Migrants from Central America and the Caribbean sometimes travel through Mexico in trucks and trailers in the hope of reaching the United States.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has claimed there is “no way” his country would send troops into Ukraine unless it is attacked, amid fears Russia’s close ally will help to facilitate a spring offensive by Moscow.  “We are peaceful people. We know what war is and we don’t want war,” the authoritarian leader Lukashenko, who has close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, said at a small gathering of journalists from international media, including CNN, at Minsk’s Palace of Independence “There is no way we are going to send our troops to Ukraine unless you are going to commit aggression against Belarus,” Lukashenko said. “But don’t forget Russia is our ally, legally, morally and politically,” he added. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, meanwhile announced that Putin will meet with Lukashenko in the Moscow region on Friday. Belarus helped Russia launch its initial invasion of Ukraine last February, allowing the Kremlin’s troops to enter the country through the 1,000-kilometer (621-mile) Ukrainian-Belarusian border to the north of Kyiv.  Minsk has since claimed on numerous occasions that Ukrainian drones and missiles have entered its territory, sometimes without providing evidence.  There have been fears throughout the conflict that Belarus will again be used as a launching ground for another offensive, or that Lukashenko’s own troops will join the conflict, citing such episodes as provocation against its sovereignty. Tensions have been mounting at the border again in recent days as Ukraine braces for a renewed attack. Lukashenko continued to say Thursday that Russia has “never asked” him to start a joint war in Ukraine. The Belarusian strongman ducked questions from international media about his country’s complicity in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.   When asked by CNN why Lukashenko continued to support what has so far been a protracted and strategically questionable war for Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Belarusian president tried to turn the tables onto the West.   “Why do you support Ukraine, pumping it with weapons instead of sitting down to negotiate as I suggest? You are already discussing sending long range weapons, missiles up to 300 kilometers in range and F 16 fighter jets, state of the art fighter jets, after hundreds of Leopard tanks have gone there. Why are you doing this? You understand this is escalation,” he said.    Lukashenko continued, saying the city of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine – the latest battleground which has been the focus of intense fighting in recent weeks – will be taken by Russian forces “one way or another.”   “Right now, the most fierce fighting is happening near Bakhmut. I know what’s going on there … Bakhmut will fall in the next few days. This will be yet another victory for Russia,” Lukashenko told a press conference when asked about his continued support for Russia’s war. “Bakhmut will be taken one way or another. Why let thousands die? But the politicians sitting at the top in Ukraine have prohibited this, and so this meatgrinder goes on,” the Belarusian leader continued.   Lukashenko maintained he wanted to see “peaceful negotiations” and accused the United States of preventing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky from negotiating.    “You are not letting him negotiate. This is my conviction. And there are many facts that speak to this. It’s you who wants war. Please wake up! The US are the only one who needs this slaughter, only they want it. Europe does not need this war, because if there is an escalation, Europe will sizzle. Europeans know it. And even the British know it, and especially Ukrainians.”   Border visit A CNN team visited Belarus’s southwest border near northwest Ukraine earlier this week, accompanied by state border officials. The CNN team were 100 meters (328 feet) away from the Ukrainian side, where they saw the Belarusian government’s fortification of the border area with barbed wire in a carefully orchestrated and tightly controlled press tour. According to the CNN team on the ground, the Ukrainian side of the border is heavily barricaded with several layers of barbed wire and earth mounds to stop anyone from going through. Belarusian officials told CNN the border crossing from their side in the small town of Dyvin is still functioning but that the Ukrainian side has closed the crossing. Kyiv has closed all border crossings to Belarus, except to occasionally allow entry to Ukrainian refugees who are looking to return to their home country, out of concern Belarus could be used for a further invasion by Russia. The CNN team could see a Ukrainian flag on Ukraine’s side of the border crossing and a red and white flag which is associated with the Belarusian opposition – a move Belarusian authorities called a “provocation.” Formerly under Soviet control until declaring its sovereignty in 1990, Belarus remains one of Russia’s closest allies and has played a key role in its invasion of Ukraine – despite Lukashenko saying previously his country was “being dragged” into the war. Russian troops launched the invasion on February 24, crossing into Ukraine from Belarus after months amassing along Ukraine’s border. In the first days of the assault, Russian Tu-22 “Backfire” bombers used Belarusian airspace to launch coordinated cruise missile attacks on targets within Ukraine. More recently, the two nations have engaged in joint military drills near the Belarus-Ukraine crossing.
